      <Typography component="p" variant="body1" sx={{ mx: "10vw", pb: 4 }}>
        I'm alittlefaun - you can call me faun (ã€ƒÏ‰ã€ƒ). I edit text files during
        the week for a living and make plushies during the weekends. I really
        enjoy the process of creating things and having that final product bring
        joy to their owners.

        Please don't hesitate to message me if you have a character that you
        would like me to bring to life!
